I am passionate about real-world projects and consistently eager to contribute to impactful solutions.


**History**

I graduated from Cross-Media Intelligent Technology Lab ([CMIT](https://cmit.fudan.edu.cn/_t4252/main.htm)) at Fudan University in 2022.06, where I was supervised by Professor [Rui Feng](https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/fengrui/zh_CN/zdylm/644047/list/index.htm). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Automation as part of the Li-Siguang Project at China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), under the guidance of Professors [Haobin Dong](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/donghaobin/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Yuan Zhu](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/zhuyuan/zh_CN/index.htm). My work experience includes internships at United Imaging Intelligence, collaborating with [Fan Yang](https://fyangneil.github.io/), where I explored multi-task learning on object detection, And a summer internship at Alipay, where I focused on graph mining to identify high-risk users.

My primary research interests lie in machine learning and computer vision, particularly in healthcare/multi-modal data understanding.
